# AntiSpawnerCamping

A simple mod to prevent Mob Spawner camping

## Description

This mod aims to prevent players from sitting on mob spawners and grinding them. After a configurable amount of spawns with player(s) in a configured range of the spawner, the mod will run (configurable) commands on the player. An example is in the config file, and a full formatting guide is available here. This is a server mod but can be used in lan world or singleplayer (if you really wanted to).
